    <br>
    <figcaption><strong><em>navigating to 'Services' not scrolling to display section header: Nav Bar - Services</em></strong></figcaption>
  </figure>
- (All browsers) Due to an unknown effect/cause, the validation message for when a users attempts to submit an invalid form (empty fields/ incorrect input format) does not appear on certain occasions . Since this occurs occasionally with no clear pattern, there is no solution for it at present.

  </figure>

- (All browsers for collapsed Nav Bar) When navigating to 'Services' section from about, success or contact-us page; the page does not scroll low enough to display the section header 'OUR SERVICES'; this is covered by the fixed Nav Bar.
